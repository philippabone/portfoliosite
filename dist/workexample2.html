I will go through all the stages that I do on here as they are completed and keep this page fully up to date.</p><p>This site will allow customers to view products when the business isn't at events, increase awareness of the business by creating another platform for people to view products, increase sales by allowing more people the chance to buy products. Currently the only way to buy products is from events and shows that they attend. There is a small selection of products available in a few farm shops. The website will also show people that they also do events such as weddings and that they can have their products as favours. They can also be contacted about special orders such as birthdays/Christmas and Easter</p><h2>Background Information</h2><p>Susans Farmhouse Fudge started when Susan Rigg began producing the fudge from the recipe that had been handed down for more than 100years. Susan began producing the fudge in 1983 and it has always been made on the banks of the river Ribble. They now produce over 12 different types of fudge as well as truffles and chocolates. Lisa (Susans daughter) took over the business in 2016 and has decided that she would like the business to have some internet presence in order to reach a wider audience.</p><h2>Client Requirements</h2><p>Lisa would like a traditional, clean cut look that represents the feel of a farmhouse brand with colours being natural colours such as brown and green. She has supplied the logo for the site, and would like it to feature on the homepage. The business also has a slogan, "A taste of the good old days", again she would like this to feature on the homepage.</p><figure><img src="images/logo.jpg" alt="Susan's Farmhouse Fudge Logo"><figcaption>Susans Farmhouse Fudge Logo</figcaption></figure><p>She would like a homepage, a page that includes background on the business, a page showing the different fudge available, a page showing the chocolates, an events page which details up and coming events and shows and highlights the fact they can do special occasions including weddings, a shop page and a contact page which will include a form and phone numbers so people can contact the business with any queries.</p><h2>Technical Constraints</h2><p>For this project the website had to be a hifi prototype and it couldn't include a database or any back-end scripting, therefore this website does not include the shop section. The client had a choice if they wish for the website to be finished after the deadline.</p><h2>Personas</h2><p>The personas created reflect the mixed group of potential users for the site including those that have little internet experience and those who may lead busy live styles with little time to browse. For this project 3 personas were created</p><figure><img src="images/finalyear/personas.png" alt="Persona created for Susans Farmhouse Fudge"><figcaption>Example of one of the personas/user journeys</figcaption></figure><h2>Card Sort</h2><p>The card sorting carried out for the site was done both open and closed and didn’t cause many problems. The general choice for the shop was to go within the fudge and chocolate page rather than buy itself as it allows for a clear browse of all the products first.</p><h2>Wireframes</h2><p>The wireframes started out as sketches on paper and then were mocked up in Axure.</p><figure><img src="images/finalyear/wireframe-sketch.png" alt="Sketch on paper of Susans Farmhouse Fudge"><figcaption>Sketch on paper of Susans Farmhouse Fudge</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="images/finalyear/wireframe-axure.png" alt="Wireframe made on Axure of the product page on Susans Farmhouse Fudge"><figcaption>One of the Axure wireframes showing the product page layout</figcaption></figure><h2>Mood board</h2><p>The client is looking for a brown/natural colour scheme and a relaxed feel about the site, nothing too formal. The pictures came from a variety of different sites and allowed a mix of styles to come together so the client had a broad base to make decisions on. The mood board allows a range of different aspects of sites to be brought together. This then is narrowed down to the style guide.</p><figure><img src="images/finalyear/moodboard.png" alt="moodboard for susans farmhouse fudge"><figcaption>Moodboard for Susans Farmhouse Fudge</figcaption></figure><h2>Style Guide</h2><figure><img src="images/finalyear/styleguide.png" alt="Styleguide for susans farmhouse fudge showing the font and colour scheme for the site"><figcaption>Simple style guide for Susans Farmhouse Fudge</figcaption></figure><p>The style guide (Appendix 8) pin point’s typography, colour, logo, images. It is more structured than a mood board, it is a final version of what is expected and allows the client to confirm about the style of the site</p><h2>My Other Work</h2><section class="prevwork"><div class="work-info"><a href="workexample.html" title="Internal Link to Work Example of Project Management" class="main-content"><div class="content work"><h2>Project Management</h2><p>In my 2nd year i was the PM for a small group of 6 with the aim to build a International Student Guide to Manchester website.</p></div></a></div></section><div class="skiptotop"><a href="#skiptotop">Skip to top</a></div></section><!-- ***  FOOTER  *** --><footer><div class="footer left"><ul><li><a title=" Internal link to Home Page" href="index.html">Home</a></li><li><a title=" Internal Link to About Me" href="about.html">About Me</a></li><li><a title="Internal Link to My Work" href="work.html">Work</a></li><li><a title="Internal link to my main Blog page" href="blog/blog.html">Blog</a></li><li><a title="Internal link to Contact page" href="contact.html">Contact Me</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer center"><ul><li><img src="images/opened-email-envelope.svg" alt=""> <a href="mailto:philippa.bone@stu.mmu.ac.uk" title="Send an Email to Philippa Bone">philippabone@stu.mmu.ac.uk</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer right"><ul><li><a href="https://www.twitter.com/p_i_p_p_a_" target="_blank"><img class="social-icon" src="images/social_media/twitter.svg" alt="External link to Philippa's Twitter profile."></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/philippa-bone-361a10a6" target="_blank"><img class="social-icon" src="images/social_media/linkedin-2.svg" alt="External link to Philippa's LinkedIn Profile."></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/philippabone" target="_blank"><img class="social-icon" src="images/social_media/github-logo.svg" alt="External link to Philippa's LinkedIn Profile."></a></li><!--<div>Icons made by <a href="http://www.flaticon.com/authors/dave-gandy" title="Dave Gandy">Dave Gandy</a> from <a href="http://www.flaticon.com" title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a> is licensed by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" title="Creative Commons BY 3.0" target="_blank">CC 3.0 BY</a></div> --></ul></div></footer></article></div><!-- JQUERY FOR NAV --><script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function(){$(".menu-icon").on("click",function(){$(this).toggleClass("menu-icon--open"),$(".main-nav").toggleClass("main-nav--open")})})</script></body></html>
