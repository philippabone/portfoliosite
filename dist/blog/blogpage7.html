The objectives are to research version control, Git and GitHub, to illustrate the knowledge by uploading the various code stages to GitHub through commits and possibly forking and to evaluate the use of Git and GitHub as a new user.</p><h2>All about Git ……</h2><p>Git was born in 2005 and was created by Linus Torvalds who also created Linux. It was first developed to manage the Linux development community. Some of the goals of the new system were (git, no date):</p><ul class="content-list"><li>Speed</li><li>Simple design</li><li>Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)</li><li>Fully distributed</li><li>Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)</li></ul><p>GitHub is a Git repository hosting service but has many other features of its own. It provides a Web-based graphical interface and provides access control and collaboration features for projects. GitHub also allows the use of “forking” in which someone can have their own copy of a repository to make changes and then those changes can be shared with the original owner by a pull request and merged if the original owner is happy</p><h2>Why I wanted to use Git...</h2><p>I decided that Git would be an ideal self-initiated project as version control is important when projects start getting larger,</p><blockquote>“No matter how hard you try, when multiple people are working on a single project without a version control system in place things get chaotic” (Web Design Depot, 2009:online)</blockquote><p>Even though I am currently only working on projects by myself I felt it was important to make sure I knew all the basics so if I ever get the chance to collaborate with others on a project then this is something that might be used or something I could introduce! The most useful aspect to version control is the fact that you have many different versions, when you save something and make a change the original copy isn’t lost.</p><p>Git is a distributed version control, this means (git,no date) that each copy of the file is a full copy and not just a snapshot. It also allows 2 people to work simultaneously on the same project and when it is pushed back up it will sort out who did what changes and merge them into the final copy, if the two people have changed the same thing Git will show it as conflict.</p><h2>Set up</h2><p>I wanted to learn how to use terminal to get my files onto GitHub and look at GitHub Desktop. I had previously looked at Git Bash on my PC but not done anymore and I had already created a GitHub account. I am now a Mac owner so will be using terminal.</p><h2>How</h2><p>To put my final year project up onto GitHub I first decided to get a good foundation of what I should know. I first did the <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/" title="External Link to CodeSchool">Code School </a>(Code School, No Date) tutorial called <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real" title="External Link to CodeSchool's Git Real Course">Git Real</a> which gave me a brief look into all the different things I could do, Git Real also includes challenges at the end which really helped me solidify what I had learnt. The challenges are pretend situations and I found this useful as it made you think what you had learnt and apply it to a new situation.</p><figure><img src="../images/blog/codeschool.jpg"><figcaption>Git Real Course on Code School</figcaption></figure><p>After completing this I also watched the Lynda.com video called <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/Welcome/409275/416541-4.html?org=mmu.ac.uk" title="External link to Lynda.com video about Git and Github">up and running with Git and Github </a>(Lynda.com, 2015), this helped me set it up for my Mac. I found this useful as it allowed me to play the video and then pause it to do the same on my laptop, this was very helpful as I could then follow along.</p><figure><img src="../images/blog/lynda_git.jpg"><figcaption>Lynda.com video about Git and GitHub</figcaption></figure><h2>Terminal and GitHub Desktop</h2><p>I then decided to apply what I had learnt to my own work. My “go to” resource was the <a href="https://git-scm.com/" title="External Link to Git scm website">git website</a> (git, no date) as this did step by step processes. I used the terminal on my Mac to set up my repository, add the files and commit them.</p><figure><img src="../images/blog/git_terminal.jpg"><figcaption>Starting out in terminal</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="../images/blog/git_terminal2.jpg"><figcaption>Commiting in terminal</figcaption></figure><p>Once I got my final year project on GitHub I threw a small party, actually it was nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be! I think the terminal looks scary and when you see people typing lots of commands things can get complex but for the simple purpose of putting things on GitHub I found it straightforward!</p><figure><img src="../images/blog/github.jpg"><figcaption>My GitHub</figcaption></figure><h2>Forking</h2><p>Forking is being able to have your own copy of someone else’s code to work on and look at. If you make changes to it that benefit or improve the original, it is possible to send it back to the original person and they can choose to view the changes and merge them if they like. This then becomes a pull request.</p><blockquote>“A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.” (GitHub Help, No Date)</blockquote><figure><img src="../images/blog/git-fork.jpg"><figcaption>Forking</figcaption></figure><h2>GitHub Desktop</h2><p>This is when I decided to try <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" title="External link to GitHub Desktop Website">GitHub Desktop </a>(GitHub Desktop, No Date) even though I had not seen many people use this before I thought I would give it a go. I found it extremely easy and straightforward, it was perfect for keeping track of changes within the files and it showed me what had been updated and allowed me to commit to the master branch and then sync so that it updated my files on GitHub.</p><h2>Evaluation</h2><p>This has been a very useful self-initiated project, I think Git and GitHub will come in very handy during projects in the future and I am going to continue putting my current projects on there. Both terminal and GitHub Desktop have been useful and I think both of them can be as equally as useful but more features are available in terminal. Becoming familiar with terminal is a good thing as it is used for many other things.</p><h2>Share it</h2><a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-show-count="false">Tweet</a><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><h2>References</h2><ul><li>Code School (No Date).
