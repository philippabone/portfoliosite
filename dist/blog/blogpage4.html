Are we limiting the creative design by starting on a small screen? Let me know <a href="mailto:philippa.bone@stu.mmu.ac.uk">what you think.</a></p><p>With Mobile First the focus is on the mobile content and what is available to the reader in the small screens, for me it made me think about what space I actually took up. With me not having much prior experience with building sites I had a tendency to want to fill space on larger screens and think of all the things I could put onto the screen to make it exciting to then find that the scaled down version looked pretty boring and not existent in comparison. I also found that by starting Mobile First it allowed for a more fluid expansion as the screens got larger. With a smaller screen you have to make whatever you want to say clear and precise so from a context point of view, Mobile First is good!</p><h2>Mobile First = Content First</h2><p>A good article by <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/a-hands-on-guide-to-mobile-first-design/" title="External link to Uxpin Article">UXPIN</a> about mobile first design says;</p><blockquote>The mobile-first approach is a tenet of progressive enhancement. It is the ideology that mobile design, as the hardest, should be done first. Once the mobile design questions are answered, designing for other devices will be easier. What it boils down to is that, the smallest of the designs will have only the essential features, so right away you have designed the heart of your UX</blockquote><p>By starting mobile first the content of your site has to be clear, this is the main reason people will visit your site. People search via mobile and want quick and clear answers; they don’t want to have to think about how to find something on your site. I find I tend to do more quick searches on my phone than on any other device, this is probably because it’s nearly enough always the closest thing to me!</p><h2>Is it important?</h2><p><a href="https://adwords.googleblog.com/2015/05/building-for-next-moment.html" title="External Link to Googles Blog">Google announced </a>last May after their AdWords Performance Submit that;</p><blockquote>Billions of times per day, consumers turn to Google for I want-to-know, I want-to-go, I want-to-do, and I want-to-buy moments. And at these times, consumers are increasingly picking up their smartphones for answers. In fact, more Google searches take place on mobile devices than on computers in 10 countries including the US and Japan. – Google</blockquote><p>Google are definitely after businesses to make sure that their site is mobile friendly, so therefore if Google is ranking mobile friendly sites first it is important that your content is right for the mobile site.

I don’t think this is the only way, but I think it’s a very useful way to start as all attention is on that small screen.</p><h2>Share it</h2><a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-show-count="false">Tweet</a><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><h2>References</h2><ul><li>Germillion, B (No Date) A Hands-On Guide To Mobile First Responsive Design.
