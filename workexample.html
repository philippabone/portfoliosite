		<h1> Project Management </h1>

			<h2>DPM</h2>
		<p>	The aim of this project was to create a website,<a href="http://www.11063905.webdevmmu.uk/dpm-website/" title="External link to my DPM website,An International Student guide in Manchester"> An International Students Guide to Manchester.</a> We saw that there was no other International Student websites for Manchester that included a large variety of different activities. In order to see what international students wanted we sent out a questionnaire and with the response came up with the main categories, food, transport, shopping, museums and galleries and nightlife. We did want to be able to translate the website to other main languages but couldn’t find a plug in available for this.</p>

			<h2>Methodology</h2>
			<p>As a team we decided that working Agile would be the best way to go as it would allow us the flexibility to work rather than something more rigid such as Waterfall as that would have meant that we would have had to finish and sign off each stage and not allow us to go back to re-done steps.</p>

			<h2>My Role</h2>

			<p>I did Bi weekly and minutes sheets which helped plan time and allowed me and Shabnaz ( other PM) to keep track of what work had been done and what still needed to be done. We had regular weekly group meeting plus the 3hrs a week in the DPM seminars.  I tried to make it as clear as possible to everyone what needed to be done, and any questions could be shared either to me or the group as a whole. I looked at the process as a whole and then worked out how each person within the team fit into that then broke it down for each of them. I tried to be aware of how people worked too, some people preferred to work together and communicate whilst working and others preferred to just get a task and go and do it themselves with little distraction. We all worked really well as a group and just had to use our conflict resolution strategy once, a member of the team started to not turn up and wouldn’t answer group texts or emails, the lecturer Gill got involved and he was given a warning but the work was picked up and distributed across the other group members due to this.</p>
